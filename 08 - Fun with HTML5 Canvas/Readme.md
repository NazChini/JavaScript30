- Learnt how to make a drawing app using the canvas HTML element. 
- Further practice with events, specifically, mouse events like mouse move, mouse down, mouse and mouseout. 
   - Used this event information to draw onto our canvas context.
- Practiced using flag boolean variables to determine  flow control. 
   - In this case, to determine width of line drawing on the canvas and also to determine if the user is ‘actively’ drawing, i.e. has the mouse pressed down while drawing.
- Used the context object’s 'globalCompositeOperation' method which works similar to photoshop blend modes.
